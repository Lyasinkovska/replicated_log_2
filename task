Iteration 2.
20 points
In the previous iteration, the replication was blocking for all secondaries, i.e. to return a response to the client
 we should receive acknowledgements (ACK) from all secondaries.


Current iteration should provide tunable semi-synchronicity for replication, by defining write concern parameters.
client POST request in addition to the message should also contain write concern parameter w=1,2,3,..,n
w value specifies how many ACKs the master should receive from secondaries before responding to the client
w = 1 - only from master
w = 2 - from master and one secondary
w = 3 - from master and two secondaries

Please emulate replicas inconsistency (and eventual consistency) with the master by introducing the artificial
delay on the secondary node. In this case, the master and secondary should temporarily return different messages lists.
Add logic for messages deduplication and to guarantee the total ordering of messages.
